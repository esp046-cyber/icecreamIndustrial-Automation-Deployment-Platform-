Virtual Ice Cream Manufacturing Plant — Interactive Presentation Mode
Interactive Plant Layout Map — A live top-down animated floor plan with all 9 plant sections: Raw Material, Mixing/Homogenization, Pasteurization, Aging Tanks, Continuous Freezer, Filling & Packaging, Cold Storage, Electrical Control Room, and Compressor Room. Each section has an animated status LED, clickable area, and hover tooltip.
Animated Process Flow — Directional flow arrows animate between all connected sections (dairy feed, mix feed, hot mix, refrigerant cycle, control signals) using dashed-line animation with arrowheads.
Guided Presentation Mode — ▶ START auto-advances through all 9 sections every 6 seconds with step-dot progress tracker. Full pause/resume/prev/next/stop controls. Each section triggers narration text, SCADA tag references, and KPI updates.
Live KPI Overlay Panel — Shows section-specific data: status, primary temperature, flow rate, PID output %, alarm status, and batch number — all contextual to the selected section.
Digital Twin Info Panel — Per section: controlling PLC model, program block, cycle time, DI/DO/AI counts, critical sensors, safety interlocks, maintenance interval, failure mode, and full control philosophy text.
Recruiter Mode Toggle — Activates a skills overlay showing "Candidate Demonstrates Knowledge In" list with a technical depth score bar per section.
Camera & View Controls — Zoom in/out, drag-to-pan, scroll-to-zoom, Reset view, plus Normal / Night / Maintenance view modes (maintenance mode shows I/O count overlays).
Export Summary — Generates and downloads a .txt plant summary report with all section data, current KPIs, and candidate evaluation reference.
